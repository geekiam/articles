      Many people believe that in order to become a good software developer,
      engineer or coder that you will need to be able 

      to write good code fast.  The truth is, that in order to write good code, you first need to be able read, comprehend

      and understand code written by others and once you've mastered that you need to be able to collaborate effectively with people, who it is quite possible you will never meet. 


      It's also a common misconception that software developers are geeks or hackers working in isolation tapping furiously 

      on their keyboards whilst solving deep and complex problems.  


      The reality is, developers probably spend only 10% of their time actually writing code.   This fact, is also discussed 

      in [The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering](https://amzn.to/2UVut64), whereby the average developer

      will generally contribute on average only 10 lines of code a day.  


      Professional Software Developers, know that there is a significant difference in rate between adding new lines of code to an

      existing large project, against starting a new project from scratch.  The difference being that when adding new lines to 

      large project, a majority of developer time, is typically spent figuring out relationships between constituent parts of the

      application code.  


      Therefore, 90% of developer time, is spent:
       * Reading
       * Interacting
       * Engaging
       * Collaborating
       * Integrating
       * Re-purposing
       * Re-engineering
       * Rewriting 


       
      This may be code developed by other software developers from all over the world, from different companies and more than

      likely different years!


      In all likelihood, on any given project, the majority of the code contained in it, will be code from many different 

      sources. You will invariably make use of Libraries, Frameworks, Components, Shared Code and at time Copy and Pasted code

      from other sources. Even the programming language you choose to develop your software is based on code developed by

      others.


      Software development, is very much a team sport, the difference being that in all probability you will never meet or 

      even get to know everybody on your team or contributing to your project.  The only aspect of those people you're ever going to 

      physically see, is their code.


      In the book [Pragmatic Programmer - Your Journey to mastery](https://amzn.to/2V8LmK8) - [Read Review](https://garywoodfine.com/book-review-the-pragmatic-programmer/) the authors also stress the importance of learning how to use Version Control Systems, as a virtual project wide time machine to enable you to view and return your project to a state when it actually was able to compile and run!
    quote:
      quote: Version control systems keep track of every change you make in your
        source code and documentation. With a properly configured source code
        control system, you can always go back to a previous version of your
        software.

    body: "The primary means developers interact with another and code, is through
      what is called a **_Source Code Repository_**

      and there are different types.  Source Code Repositories can be
      either _Public_ or _Private_ and sometimes they

      can be a mixture of both.

      sold; warehouse

      > 5. a receptacle containing the relics of the dead
